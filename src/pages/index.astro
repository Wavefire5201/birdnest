      Beijing National Stadium - The Bird's Nest
    </h1>
    <div class="text-3xl">Overview</div>
    <p class="text-justify">
      The Beijing National Stadium, also known as the “Bird's Nest,” is an
      iconic structure located in Beijing's Olympic Green, designed by Swiss
      architects Herzog & de Meuron, artist Ai Weiwei, and China Architecture
      Design & Research Group. Constructed between 2003 and 2008 for the Summer
      Olympics, its striking steel lattice exterior (using 42,000 tons of steel)
      and original capacity of 91,000 spectators made it a global symbol of
      China's modernity. Primarily hosting Olympic ceremonies, athletics, and
      soccer, it later adapted to secondary roles, including concerts,
      exhibitions, tourism (with guided tours and museums), and commercial
      events. Post-Olympics, its capacity was reduced to ~80,000, and it now
      serves as a sustainable, multi-functional hub integrated with public park
      spaces, avoiding underuse through adaptive reuse. The stadium's cultural
      legacy, alongside the nearby Water Cube, cements its status as a
      21st-century architectural marvel and a model of large-scale venue
      sustainability.
