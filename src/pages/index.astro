      <div class="text-justify">
        The Beijing National Stadium, also known as the “Bird's Nest,” is an
        iconic structure located in Beijing's Olympic Green, designed by Swiss
        architects Herzog & de Meuron, artist Ai Weiwei, and China Architecture
        Design & Research Group. Constructed between 2003 and 2008 for the
        Summer Olympics, its striking steel lattice exterior (using 42,000 tons
        of steel) and original capacity of 91,000 spectators made it a global
        symbol of China's modernity. Primarily hosting Olympic ceremonies,
        athletics, and soccer, it later adapted to secondary roles, including
        concerts, exhibitions, tourism (with guided tours and museums), and
        commercial events. Post-Olympics, its capacity was reduced to ~80,000,
        and it now serves as a sustainable, multi-functional hub integrated with
        public park spaces, avoiding underuse through adaptive reuse. The
        stadium's cultural legacy, alongside the nearby Water Cube, cements its
        status as a 21st-century architectural marvel and a model of large-scale
        venue sustainability.

        Architecture and Nation Building in the Age of Globalization:
        Construction of the National Stadium of Beijing for the 2008 Olympics
      </div>
      <div>
        This paper explores how China's National Stadium for the 2008 Olympics
        became a symbol of both nationalist ambition and globalized identity.
        The stadium sparked debates between cultural conservatives criticizing
        its cost and foreign influence and liberals advocating for international
        collaboration. The government's pause on construction to revise the
        design highlights tensions between showcasing China's rise and managing
        domestic critiques of extravagance. Ultimately, the project reflects how
        global architecture is used to narrate national pride in an era of
        economic and political globalization.

        Development of a Multitype Wireless Sensor Network for the Large-Scale
        Structure of the National Stadium in China
      </div>
      <div>
        This research article describes the development and implementation of a
        wireless sensor network (WSN) for monitoring China's National Stadium.
        The system uses 290 different sensors to measure various structural
        parameters like stress, displacement, acceleration, wind, and
        temperature across the massive 40,000-ton steel structure. The WSN
        employs a chain-type network topology with 98 sensor nodes organized
        into eight areas, allowing for flexible monitoring of the stadium's
        health over more than a year - revealing interesting findings about how
        temperature significantly affects the structure's behavior despite its
        apparent rigidity.
