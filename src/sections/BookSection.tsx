        1000 Years of Joys and Sorrows: A Memoir by Ai Weiwei, translated by

          The stadium&apos;s design was inspired by Chinese ceramics and was
          conceived to represent democracy and transparency, with its exposed
          structure symbolizing the openness that Ai Weiwei hoped would emerge
          in Chinese society.

          Despite helping design this iconic Olympic venue, Ai Weiwei did not
          attend the 2008 Olympics opening ceremony in the stadium he helped
          create, as he had become increasingly critical of how the Games were
          being used as propaganda rather than as a true opening of Chinese
          society.

          In his memoir, Ai Weiwei has distanced himself from the Bird&apos;s
          Nest project, viewing it as part of what he calls China&apos;s
          &quot;pretend smile&quot; and stating he has &quot;no feelings&quot;
          about its continued use, acknowledging that once created, they
          &quot;can do whatever they want with it&quot;.
