  "The Beijing National Stadium, also known as the “Bird's Nest,” is an iconic structure located in Beijing's Olympic Green, designed by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron, artist Ai Weiwei, and China Architecture Design & Research Group. Constructed between 2003 and 2008 for the Summer Olympics, its striking steel lattice exterior (using 42,000 tons of steel) and original capacity of 91,000 spectators made it a global symbol of China's modernity. Primarily hosting Olympic ceremonies, athletics, and soccer, it later adapted to secondary roles, including concerts, exhibitions, tourism (with guided tours and museums), and commercial events. Post-Olympics, its capacity was reduced to ~80,000, and it now serves as a sustainable, multi-functional hub integrated with public park spaces, avoiding underuse through adaptive reuse. The stadium's cultural legacy cements its status as a 21st-century architectural marvel and a model of large-scale venue sustainability.";
