          The Beijing National Stadium, also known as the “Bird&apos;s Nest,” is
          an iconic structure located in Beijing&apos;s Olympic Green, designed
          by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron, artist Ai Weiwei, and China
          Architecture Design & Research Group. Constructed between 2003 and
          2008 for the Summer Olympics, its striking steel lattice exterior and
          original capacity of 91,000 spectators made it a global symbol of
          China&apos;s modernity. Primarily hosting Olympic ceremonies,
          athletics, and soccer, it later adapted to secondary roles, including
          concerts, exhibitions, tourism, and commercial events. Post-Olympics,
          its capacity was reduced to ~80,000, and it now serves as a
          sustainable, multi-functional hub integrated with public park spaces,
          avoiding underuse through adaptive reuse. The stadium&apos;s cultural
          legacy cements its status as a 21st-century architectural marvel and a
          model of large-scale venue sustainability.

          “I don&apos;t remember exactly if I&apos;ve visited the inside of the
          building or not, but I know I&apos;ve seen it from the outside at a
          good distance before, since I lived in Beijing when I was younger. I
          think my first impression was that it was big. It was a very big
          building, and I felt very small next to it. Being a huge stadium meant
          to hold almost a hundred thousand people means it was massive. Of
          course, I recognized the bird nest-like design immediately and
          wondered what it was for, as I didn&apos;t know what the building was
          for at first.”
