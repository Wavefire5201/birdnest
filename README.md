# Scavenger Hunt Showcase

Made for ARC308. I impulsively made this website in 10 hours straight (9PM - 8AM lel). This was my first time building with NextJS and using more React. It wasn't so bad after all.

Couldn't figure out on a design at first but saw a cool animation from motion so I took inspiration. Overall design is very spaced out
and built upon over time. I thought it looked very bad at first but it became more "aesthetic" and "artistic".
